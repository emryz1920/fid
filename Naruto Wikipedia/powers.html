  <h3>Kekkei Genaki</h3>
  <p>A kekkei genkai is an anomaly of the DNA that allows the wielder to use unique techniques. A kekkei genkai's name describes both the anomaly and the resulting technique.</p>
  <h3>Hiden Techniques</h3>
  <p>Hiden or simply "secret" techniques are passed down from generation to generation in certain regions or clans.
The groups who possess these techniques are usually extremely secretive about them in order to ensure that no one other than the members of the group or clan learns them. As such, they are passed down through oral means instead of being written down or recorded.</p>
<h3>Chakra Natures</h3>
<p>Nature Transformation is an advanced form of chakra control that entails the moulding and defining of the nature of one's chakra, altering its properties and characteristics for use in techniques. Nature transformation is one of two necessary components for creating or modifying a technique, the second component being shape transformation.</p>
<h3>Jutsu</h3>
<p>Jutsu are the mystical arts a ninja will utilise in battle. To use a technique, the ninja will need to use their chakra. To perform a technique, the ninja will bring out and release the two energies of chakra. Jutsu are the mystical arts a ninja will utilise in battle.

<h3>Chakra</h3>
<p>Chakra is essential to even the most basic jutsu. Through various methods, the most common of which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or creating illusions. Chakra is ordinarily not visible to the unaided eye unless it is highly concentrated or manifested in large amounts.</p>
